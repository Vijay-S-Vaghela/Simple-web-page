<h3 align="center"><b>AI Topics</b></h3>

<p><b>Knowledge Representation</b> 
<ul>

<li>A knowledge representation (KR) is a surrogate, a substitute for
the thing itself, used to enable an entity to determine consequences
by thinking rather than acting, i.e., by reasoning about the world
rather than taking action in it.

<li>It has three components: (i) the representation's fundamental
conception of intelligent reasoning; (ii) the set of inferences the
representation sanctions; and (iii) the set of inferences it
recommends.

<li>It is a medium for pragmatically efficient computation, providing
guidance for organizing information to facilitate making inferences.

<li>It is a medium of human expression, i.e., a language in which we
say things about the world.  </ul>

<p><b>KR As Surrogate</b> 
<ul>

<li>A stand-in for things that exist in the world.

<li>It is a component of the reasoning system.

<li>The representation stands for something in the real world

<li>there must be a connection between them 

<li>this defines the semantics or meaning of the representation.

<li>How close is a representation to the represented object? Which
properties of the object should be present in the representation and
which can be omitted?

<li>Representations are imperfect: they contain simplifying
assumptions and maybe artifacts.  
</ul>

<p><b>Ontological Engineering</b> 
<ul>

<li><i>Ontology</i> - branch of philosophy studying entities that
exist, their classification, and the relations between them.

<li>Types of entities: physical objects, abstract objects, time,
locations, actions, events, beliefs.

<li>Decisions made on imperfect representations can be wrong. We must
choose the representation with this in mind.

<li>Selecting a particular representation means making an ontological
commitment.  </ul>
<!-- -->
<p><b>Ontology Example</b> <br>
<img src="1.png">

<p><b>KB and Database</b> 
<ul>

<li>The KB in a program can be represented as a relational database.

<li>The larger the KB, the better its structure must be thought from
the start.

<li>The database should be consistent in terms of connectivity - if
something changes in one place, the change must be reflected
everywhere else.

<li>The database must be unified, meaning that we must be able to use
its various components within the same framework. A particular
application may require more than 1 component.  
</ul>

<p><b>Expert Systems</b> 
<ul>

<li>Programs that incorporate knowledge of a particular domain and
that can help with making decisions.

<li>They often emerge from the retirement of a human expert that takes
time and effort to replace.

<li>Basic components: a knowledge base KB and an inference system.

<li>The expertise is organized in rules of type "if-then" by a human
expert.

<li>For classification/diagnosis problems this often results in a
tree.  
</ul>

<p><b>General Functionality</b> 
<ul>

<li>The user seeks a diagnosis or goal (car failure). 

<li>The system asks a question, often with a yes/no answer. 

<li>If this answer is not sufficient to determine the diagnosis
completely, another question will be asked.

<li>Some of the systems can allow for an undetermined answer (I don't
know) and they can adapt to that,

<li>The answer might be given with a certain probability.

<li>In general they avoid asking for irrelevant input.
</ul>

<p><b>Example - Car Classification</b><br>
<img src="2.png">

<p><b>Semantic Networks</b> 
<ul>

<li>A graph notation for representing knowledge. The nodes are
concepts and the edges are relations between them.

<li><i>Definitional</i> networks - the relations are subtype or is-a. 

<li><i>Assertional</i> networks are designed to assert propositions. 

<li><i>Implicational</i> networks use implication to connect nodes. 

<li><i>Executable</i> networks can include procedures. 

<li><i>Learning</i> networks build or extend their representations by
acquiring knowledge from examples.

<li><i>Hybrid</i> networks combine two or more of the previous
techniques.  
</ul>

<p><b>Example - Definition Network</b> <br>
<img src="3.png">

<p><b>Categories and Objects</b> 
<ul>

<li>Organizing the objects in categories.

<li>Some reasoning takes places at the level of categories.

<li>"I want to eat an apple." 

<li>Apple(x), or Member(x, Apple) and Subset(Apple, Food).

<li>The categories form a hierarchy where each class inherits the
properties of the parent, or simply a network (apples are both food
and fruit).

<li>The categories of a class compose a taxonomy.
</ul>

<p><b>Partitioning</b> 
<ul>

<li>Two or more categories are disjoint if they are mutually exclusive
(male/female).

<li>A decomposition of a class into categories is called exhaustive if
each object of the class must belong to at least one category

<li>living = {animal,  vegetable, fungi, bacteria}

<li>A partition is a an exhaustive decomposition of a class into
disjoint subsets.

<li>student = {undergraduate, graduate}

<li>Related problem: clustering. Given a set of objects, find an
appropriate category for each of them. The categories may not be
predefined.  </ul>

<p><b>Attributes</b> 
<ul>

<li>Composition: PartOf(nose, face).

<li>Some categories can be defined as rules:

<li>Biped(x) =&gt; <img src="exists.gif" height="17"> b1, b2 (Leg(b1)
&amp; Leg(b2) &amp; PartOf(b1, x) &amp; PartOf(b2, x) &amp; !equal(b1,
b2).

<li>Prime(n) &lt;=&gt; (Number(n) &amp; n != 1 &amp; <img
src="forall.gif" height="17">d (equal(n%d, 0) =&gt; (equal(d, 1) |
(equal(d, n))))

<li>Measurements: Length(x), Price(x), etc. These are functions, not
predicates.

<li>Things: 3 apples. Stuff: water, more water, some quantity of
water.  
</ul>

<p><b>Situations</b>
<ul>

<li>Situation: a predicate that is true at a particular moment in
time. They may also have a specific location. A particular state of
the system.

<li>Drives(Mary, car, I90, 03/15/096)

<li><i>Fluent</i>: predicates and functions that can change from a
moment to another. Happy(x).

<li>Atemporal or eternal predicates: Warrior(A) will be true for as
long as the object A exists. Alive(A) may change from a moment to the
next.  </ul>

<p><b>Actions</b> 
<ul>

<li>Predicates that represent changes in the environment. The involve
at least a subject, often one or more objects.

<li>eat(x, y), sleep(x), talk(x), say(x, y)

<li>When an action is part of a situation, it can result in other
predicates becoming true at a later moment in time.

<li>(Eat(x, y, t) &amp; Apple(y)) =&gt; !Hungry(x, t+1)

<li>Projection: the agent can use some rules to predict the outcome of
its possible actions and choose the appropriate one. This is done by
planning.  
</ul>

<p><b>Situation Calculus</b> 
<ul>

<li>Description of an action:

<li>Possibility rule (precondition): a sentence that specifies when an
action is possible.

<li>has(x, y, s) &amp; apple(y) =&gt; Possible(eat(x, y), s)

<li>Effect rule (postcondition): a sentence that describes the
consequences of an action.

<li>eat(x, y, s) =&gt; !exist(y, s+1)

<li>collect(x, y, s) =&gt; has(x, y, s+1)

<li>Frame problem: the collection of things / predicates that don't
change.  </ul>

<p><b>Time and Events</b> 
<ul>

<li>In time-based calculus the fluents are valid for particular
moments in time instead of in a particular situation.

<li>A fluent is true at a particular point in time if it was initiated
or caused by an event in the past, and was not terminated by another
event in the meantime.

<li>Initiates(e, f, t), e-event, f-fluent, t-time.

<li>Terminates(e, f, t). Happens(e, t). Clipped(f, t, t2)

<li>T(f, t2) &lt;=&gt; <img src="exists.gif" height="17"> e, t
(Happens(e, t) &amp; Initiates(e, f, t) &amp; (t &lt; t2) &amp;
!Clipped(f, t, t2) )

<li>Clipped(f, t, t2) &lt;=&gt; <img src="exists.gif" height="17"> e,
t1 (Happens(e, t1) &amp; Terminates(e, f, t1) &amp; (t &lt; t1) &amp;
(t1 &lt; t2) ) </ul>

<p><b>Mental Processes</b> 
<ul>

<li>Does an agent know that he knows something?

<li>We need to represent the fact that an agent believes something to
be true or knows something to be true.

<li>We can make inferences about things an agent believes, things that
the agent knows, and things that are true, but the combinations are
not always possible.

<li>The inferences can be made only if the agent is a logical agent
capable of reasoning.

<li>This is called modal logic.
</ul>

<p><b>Beliefs</b> 
<ul>

<li>Believes(x, P(a)) x believes that P(a) is true.

<li>Inferences are not obvious. 

<li>Believes(x, P(a)) &amp; (a = b) does not imply that Believes(x,
P(b)) is also true.

<li>We can apply reasoning within the system of beliefs for a logical
agent:

<li>Believes(x, P(a)) &amp; Believes(x, P(y) =&gt; Q(y)) can imply
that Believes(x, Q(a)).

<li>We can't apply MP if the agent doesn't know or believe that P(y)
=&gt; Q(y).  
</ul>

<p><b>Knowledge and Belief</b> 
<ul>

<li>Knows(x, P(a)) is similar to Believes, but the fact P(a) must be
true.

<li>KnowsWhether(x, P(a)) means Knows(x, P(a)) | Knows(x, !P(a)).

<li>KnowsWhat(x, EyeColor(a)) means that <img src="exists.gif"
height="17"> y Color(y) &amp; Knows(x, (EyeColor(a) = y)).

<li>Believes(x, P(a)) &amp; Knows(x, P(y)=&gt;Q(y)) implies
Believes(x, Q(a)).

<li>Knows(x, P(a)) &amp; Believes (x, P(y)=&gt;Q(y)) implies
Believes(x, Q(a)).

<li>Knows(x, P(a)) &amp; Knows(x, P(y)=&gt;Q(y)) implies Knows(x,
Q(a)).  
</ul>

<p><b>Fuzzy Logic</b> 
<ul>

<li>First author: Lotfi Zadeh, University of California at Berkley,
1965.

<li><b>Def.</b> Part of logic dealing with approximate reasoning,
derived from the fuzzy set theory.

<li>A fuzzy set is one to which elements belong with a given
percentage.

<li>In fuzzy logic the truth values belong to the interval [0, 1]
representing a percentage of truth.

<li>It is better suited to represent imprecise information/attributes
from the real world and to make appropriate inferences.  </ul>

<p><b>Fuzzy Logic Expressions</b> 
<ul>

<li>Classic logic: "Bill is a tall person."

<li>Tall(Bill) or Attribute(Bill, Tall) or 

<li>in terms of sets, Bill belongs to TallPeopleSet

<li>Fuzzy logic: "Bill is 80% tall."

<li>Tall(Bill) = 0.8 or

<li>Bill belongs to TallPeopleSet by 80%

<li>We can also describe Bill as "quite tall" (80%) or "very
tall"(95%) or "almost tall" (60%).

<li>It can apply to any comparable attributes:

<li>"Bill is taller than John."

<li>Tall(Bill) > Tall(John)
</ul>

<p><b>Hedges</b> 
<ul>

<li>Hedges were introduced by Zadeh (MIT/IBM) and Lakoff (Berkley) 
in fuzzy logic and represent modifier to fuzzy sets:

<li>All-purpose: very, quite, extremely

<li>Truth values: quite true, mostly false

<li>Probabilities: likely, not very likely

<li>Quantifiers, most, several, few

<li>Possibilities, like almost impossible, quite possible.
</ul>

<p><b>Examples of Deductions</b> 
<ul>

<li>This stream is narrow.

<li>This stream and that stream are approximately equal.

<li>Thus, that stream is more or less narrow.

<li>Most men are vain.

<li>Socrates is a man.

<li>Thus, Socrates is most likely vain.
</ul>

<p><b>FL Versus Probabilities</b> 
<ul>

<li><i>Classic logic:</i> "The pony is pretty." 

<li>Either True or False.

<li><i>Fuzzy logic:</i> "The pony is 90% pretty."

<li>This means that about 90% of the people looking at the pony will
think it's pretty. We're talking about one particular pony.

<li><i>Probabilities:</i> "The pony has 90% chances to be pretty." 

<li>This means that for the given population of ponies in our model,
90% of them are pretty. So 9 out of 10 ponies picked at random are
expected to be pretty.  
</ul>

<p><b>Operators</b> 
<ul>

<li>Zadeh operators:

<li>or - value(A | B ) = max{value(A), value(B)}

<li>and - value(A &amp; B) = min{value(A), value(B)}

<li>not - value(!A) = 1-value(A)

<li>Example: Annie is 90% tired and 75% cranky. Then Annie is

<li>90% tired or cranky, 

<li>75% tired and cranky,

<li>10% rested, and

<li>25% is in a good mood.

<li>Other more complex metrics are also available.
</ul>

<p><b>Applications</b> 
<ul>

<li>Automobile subsystems, such as ABS and cruise control 

<li>Microcontrollers, microprocessors, robotics.

<li>Air conditioners, cameras, dishwashers, elevators.

<li>Search engines (web)

<li>The MASSIVE engine used in the Lord of the Rings films to create
huge scale armies with random but somewhat orderly movements

<li>Digital image processing, edge detection.

<li>AI agents for games

<li>Language filters on message boards for filtering out offensive
text.  
</ul>

<p><b>Fuzzy Controller</b> 
<ul>

<li>A controller using fuzzy values for variables and rules like 

<li>IF variable IS value THEN action

<li>The rules are not mutually exclusive.

<li>Example: controller for an air conditioner:

<li>IF temperature IS very cold THEN stop fan 

<li>IF temperature IS cold THEN turn down fan 

<li>IF temperature IS normal THEN maintain level 

<li>IF temperature IS hot THEN speed up fan 
</ul>

<p><b>Example of Fuzzy Sets - car speed</b><br>
<img src="4.png">

<p><b>Fuzzy Controller Structure</b><br>
<img src="5.png">

<p><b>Example of Fuzzification - car speed</b><br>
<img src="6.png">

<p><b>Defuzification Example</b> 
<ul>

<li>Rule1: If the car is slow then increase the speed by 10.
<li>Since we got a 0.75% slow -> +10*0.75
<li>Rule2: If the car is fast, then decrease the speed by 10.
<li>Fuzzy value for fast = 0.25 => -10*0.25.
<li>Crisp answer: <br>
(10*0.75 � 10*0.25)/(0.75+0.25)  = +5
</ul>
